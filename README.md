## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `perse` an experimental, high level package to leverage best of three giants Pandas, Polars and Duckdb.


## ðŸ”§ Projects & Packages

Here are some of my notable open-source projects:
##### Python 
- **[perse](https://github.com/SermetPekin/perse)** â€“ A high level framework to leverage best of three giants, Pandas, Polars and Duckdb
- **[nameisok](https://github.com/SermetPekin/nameisok)** â€“ A tool to check if a package name is available on PyPI, complete with similarity checks and BigQuery integration.
- **[evdschat](https://github.com/SermetPekin/evdschat)** â€“ An open-source RAG application for data aggregation with PyPI.
- **[evdspy](https://github.com/SermetPekin/evdspy)** â€“   python package to retrieve data from CBRT API.
- **[backupp](https://github.com/SermetPekin/backupp)** â€“  A utility package to backup folders with a .gitignore file as git does.
- **[eseas](https://github.com/SermetPekin/eseas)** â€“ `eseas` is a seasonal adjustment Python package that acts as a wrapper for the `jwsacruncher` Java package.
